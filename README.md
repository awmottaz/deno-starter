# Deno boilerplate

This is my setup for a Deno app.

## Getting started

Install [Velociraptor](https://velociraptor.run/).

```sh
deno install -qAn vr https://deno.land/x/velociraptor@1.0.1/cli.ts
```

Optionally, add completions to your shell:
https://velociraptor.run/docs/cli/#shell-completions.

Once installed, run `vr` to see a list of available scripts.
